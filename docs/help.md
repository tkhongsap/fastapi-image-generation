# ArtGen Help Guide

Welcome to ArtGen! This guide will help you generate amazing images in just a few minutes.

## Quick Start

1. **Enter a descriptive prompt**: Type what you want to see in the "Prompt" field. Be specific and detailed for better results.
2. **Choose your model**: Select from GPT Image (newest), DALL·E 3, or DALL·E 2.
3. **Set options**: Adjust size, quality, and number of images if needed.
4. **Generate**: Click the "Generate Image" button and wait for your creation!

## Prompt Tips

Great prompts get great results! Here are some tips:

- **Be specific**: "A medieval castle on a cliff overlooking a stormy sea at sunset" is better than just "a castle".
- **Include details**: Mention lighting, atmosphere, style, colors, and perspective.
- **Specify art styles**: Try "in the style of watercolor", "photorealistic", "anime style", etc.
- **Use references**: Mention artists or periods (e.g., "like Van Gogh", "cyberpunk aesthetic").
- **Avoid negatives**: Describe what you want, not what you don't want.

## Advanced Options Explained

- **Size**: 
  - Square (1024×1024) - Perfect for balanced compositions
  - Landscape (1792×1024) - Better for wide scenes
  - Portrait (1024×1792) - Ideal for character portraits or tall subjects

- **Quality**:
  - Medium - Faster generation with good detail
  - Standard - Better detail with standard generation time
  - HD - Highest detail (DALL·E 3 only)

- **Number of Images**: Create up to 10 variations per prompt (limited by your API usage).

## Download & Rights

- **Downloading**: Click the download button underneath any generated image to save it locally.
- **Usage Rights**: Images you generate are yours to use within the [OpenAI usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies). This includes:
  - Personal and commercial use
  - Modification and adaptation
  - Publishing online or in print

Always review the most current OpenAI policies for image generation usage rights.

## Troubleshooting

- **Image fails to generate**: Check your internet connection and try again.
- **"Error" message**: Your prompt might contain content that violates usage policies. Try rewording it.
- **Slow generation**: Large, high-quality images take longer to process. Try reducing quality or size.
- **Results don't match prompt**: Try being more specific in your prompt or use different keywords.
- **Model unavailable**: The service might be temporarily at capacity. Try a different model or wait.
